    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>
      <b>D4X.io - a decentralized protocol for creating and managing leveraged trading
      positions in the cryptocurrency market.</b> It aims to bring the benefits of
      blockchain technology, such as transparency, security, and accessibility, to
      the world of leverage trading.
    </p>
    
    <b>Main idea</b>
    <p>
      D4X is designed as a protocol that allows traders to establish long and short
      positions in the cryptocurrency market by automatically borrowing funds from
      investors in the ALP Pool. Traders could use leverage, which means they can
      control a larger position with a smaller amount of capital. The trader
      receives the entire profit from opening and closing positions, after deducting
      fees as a percentage for utilizing borrowed funds from investors in the APL
      Pool and the protocol fees.
    </p>
    
    <b>Fairness of trades</b>
    <p>
      Fairness of trades is preserved by using cryptocurrency exchange rates and
      performing swap operations directly on particular decentralized DEXes. This
      method removes the need for middlemen and minimizes the possibility of price
      manipulation or preferential treatment, guaranteeing that trades take place in
      a transparent and trustless environment.
    </p>
    
    <b>Security of Investors funds</b>
    <p>
      All open positions of traders are fully supported by swap operations on
      integrated DEXes and are 100% covered by corresponding amounts of
      cryptocurrencies resulting from these swaps. To protect investors' funds and
      to prevent traders from facing substantial losses, the protocol integrates an
      automated decentralized Liquidation mechanism for opened positions. In
      addition to this, the Insurance Fund is established, which safeguards
      investors of ALP Pools and provides the first level of coverage for
      hypothetical losses resulting from unfavorable swap rates, slippage and delays
      during the liquidation process.
    </p>
    
    <b>Summary</b>
    <p>
      By offering a decentralized solution for leverage trading, D4X aims to provide
      a more transparent, secure, and accessible way to participate in the global
      cryptocurrency market. However, it's crucial for users to understand the risks
      associated with leveraged trading and to consider their own risk tolerance
      before engaging in such activities.
    </p>
    
    <h2>How it Works</h2>
    <b>Investor</b>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Invest funds in the ALP pool to earn profits from lending leverage to
        traders for fee.
      </li>
      <li>Receive LP tokens that can be redeemed or sold on the open market.</li>
      <li>
        Earn additional profits from the AAVE protocol for idle funds (not in
        positions).
      </li>
    </ol>
    
    <b>Trader</b>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Buy and sell leveraged positions of coins using funds borrowed from the ALP
        pool.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reap profits in favorable market conditions and incur losses in unfavorable
        ones.
      </li>
      <li>
        Trader's positions may be automatically liquidated to protect the credited
        funds and prevent larger losses for the trader.
      </li>
    </ol>
    
    <b>D4X Engine</b>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Calculate the maximum leverage for positions using the Margin Engine,
        granting traders access to borrowed funds.
      </li>
      <li>Oversee the liquidation process in a fully decentralized manner.</li>
    </ol>
    <b>Insurance Fund</b>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Protects investors against potential losses resulting from unexpected events
        during the liquidation swap process.
      </li>
      <li>
        Accumulates rewards for the DAO Community, contributing to the overall
        sustainability and growth of the platform.
      </li>
    </ol>
    
    <b>DAO Community</b>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Govern the protocol through decentralized decision-making, with participants
        voting on proposals and updates related to the platform.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>
  <b
    >Kolo Protocol - censorship resistant trading platform for sensitive
    information with transparent notary mechanics.</b
  >
  Organize auctions, tenders, p2p-sales for exclusive content or services.
  Crowdfund DeScience projects or online meetings with celebrities. Trade files,
  storage, computing or access.
</p>

<b>Description</b>
<p>
  Filecoin's main value proposition is providing a decentralized and
  censorship-resistant alternative to traditional cloud storage providers.
  That's why we've built a tool that creates new use cases for enlarging the
  network and illuminating the uniqueness of Filecoin.
</p>
<p>
  Kolo is a cutting-edge project being developed for the FVM Space Warp
  Hackathon. It aims to create a fair and censorship-resistant platform for
  trading sensitive information, leveraging the power of the Filecoin network
  and governed by the DAO.
</p>

<b>Main idea of Kolo</b>
<p>
  With Kolo, users will be able to buy and sell a wide variety of files,
  storage, and computing resources, as well as gain access to exclusive content.
  This includes everything from sensitive business documents and information of
  public interest to unique and valuable data sets.
</p>

<b>Types of trading</b>
<p>
  We've started with auctions, tenders and p2p sales, but the DAO members will
  be able to implement new ways of development and new use cases of the
  platform.
</p>

<b>Examples of use</b>
<p>
  As DeFi enthusiasts, we see a huge perspective in commodity trading,
  minimizing intermediary's role and including developing countries into the
  global trade and hedging with Kolo.
</p>
<p>
  Our platform can also be used for monetizing users' personal data on their
  behalf and by their initiative, contrary to the traditional system where all
  data is owned and traded by large corporations.
</p>
<p>
  We also offer the ability to organize exclusive online meetings with
  celebrities and experts. This can include everything from AMA sessions and
  live chats to virtual meet-and-greets and more.
</p>
<p>
  Kolo can be used as a tender platform to easily start and run charity and
  science projects, building a solid foundation for decentralized society
  (DeSoc) and decentralized science as it was described by Vitalik Buterin.
</p>

<b>Notary mechanics</b>
<p>
  Perhaps most importantly, we power our platform with transparent notary
  mechanics. This means that the buyer will be able to start the dispute if he
  considers the seller cheated him with file description.
</p>
<p>
  Notaries will be chosen randomly from a list of DAO participants who deposited
  a notary collateral. If the seller is confident in the high quality of his
  goods or service, he can offer a guarantee deposit, which will be used as a
  payment to notaries if the buyer will initiate a dispute and win it.
</p>

<b>DAO</b>
<p>
  Open reputation system lets everyone see any participant's actions' history
  and reviews, but decisions about its design will be made by DAO in the future.
</p>

<b>Summary</b>
<p>
  Overall, Kolo is an innovative and exciting project that has the potential to
  revolutionize the way sensitive information is handled and shared online. With
  its use of cutting-edge technology and its commitment to transparency and
  fairness, it is sure to make a big impact in the world of online auctions and
  information sharing.
</p>

<h2>How it Works</h2>
<p>
  Kolo Protocol brings together Sellers, Buyers, Notaries, and the DAO Community
  in a cohesive ecosystem.
</p>

<b>Seller</b>
<ul>
  <li>
    Initiates a new item (file, link, or other) for sale through Auction or
    Simple Trade.
  </li>
  <li>
    Answers potential buyers' questions in a special Chat, helping buyers grasp
    the item and these answers will be considered in the event of a dispute due
    to non-compliance.
  </li>
</ul>

<b>Buyer</b>
<ul>
  <li>
    Participates in Auction or Simple Trade and eventually purchases the item.
  </li>
  <li>
    They can also initiate a dispute through the Notary system if the item does
    not match the description provided by the seller or in the Chat section.
  </li>

    <h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>
  <b>GoDerivatives Protocol is a fully decentralized platform for trading Contracts
  for Difference (CFD) derivatives.</b>
</p>

<b>Main idea</b>
<p>
  CFDs are financial instruments that allow traders to speculate on the price
  movement of an underlying asset, such as stocks, commodities, or
  cryptocurrencies, without actually owning the asset. In a decentralized
  GoDerivatives platform, the process of trading and settling contracts is done
  via a distributed network, typically built on blockchain technology.
</p>

<b>Main functional</b>
<p>
  Two traders looking to place bets on an underlying asset reaching a specific
  level meet on the platform. One of the traders (Maker) initiates a new order
  with specific conditions and parameters related to the underlying asset. The
  second trader (Taker) can confirm this order. If the order is confirmed, the
  trade is considered to be started.
</p>

<p>
  To initiate the order, the Maker must deposit a collateral into the smart
  contract based on the percentage chosen in the order parameters (e.g., 10%).
  The Taker is also required to deposit the same amount of collateral into the
  smart contract. In this way, the risk of non-performance of obligations by
  both parties will be covered from both sides at the level chosen when creating
  the order.
</p>

<p>
  After the Duration period of the deal ends, the GoDerivatives protocol checks
  the price of the underlying asset against the oracle data and automatically
  calculates the winning and losing shares based on the CFD pattern. From this
  point on, both the Maker and the Taker can initiate the return of the
  collaterals, either deducting the loss or adding the profit they are entitled
  to. This system assumes that the maximum profit or loss is limited to the
  collaterals deposited by both parties and is, in essence, 100% covered, as the
  collaterals are frozen in the smart contract until the final calculations of
  gains and losses are made.
</p>

<b>Keepers system</b>
<p>
  In the GoDerivatives platform, a Keeper can create new markets for new
  underlying assets to be used by Makers and Takers. To do this, the Keeper
  freezes collateral to provide liquidity for the new market and sets up an
  Automated Market Maker (AMM) strategy.
</p>

<b>Summary</b>
<p>
  GoDerivatives is a decentralized platform for trading Contracts for Difference
  (CFD) derivatives on various underlying assets. It allows users to create and
  confirm orders through a trustless, secure, and transparent system. The
  platform utilizes Automated Market Maker (AMM) strategies to facilitate
  trading and manage liquidity. This dynamic ecosystem offers a wide range of
  trading opportunities and encourages active user participation in the
  platform's growth and development.
</p>

<h2>How it Works</h2>
<b>Trader Maker</b>
<ul>
  <li>
    The Maker and Taker find each other on the GoDerivatives platform, looking
    to trade on the same underlying asset.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Maker creates a new order specifying the conditions, such as the price
    level, the percentage of collateral, and the duration of the contract.
  </li>
</ul>

<b>Trader Taker</b>
<ul>
  <li>
    The Maker deposits the required collateral into the platform's smart
    contract. The collateral could be in the form of a stablecoin,
    cryptocurrency, or tokenized asset.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Taker reviews the order and, if they agree to the conditions, confirms
    the order by depositing their share of the collateral into the smart
    contract.
  </li>
  <li>
    Once both parties have deposited their collateral, the smart contract locks
    the funds and monitors the underlying asset's price throughout the
    contract's duration.
  </li>
</ul>

<b>GoDerivative's Engine</b>
<ul>
  <li>
    After the Duration period ends, the GoDerivatives protocol checks the
    underlying asset's price against the Oracle data and calculates the profits
    and losses based on the CFD pattern.
  </li>
  <li>
    Both the Maker and the Taker can then initiate the return of their
    collaterals, either deducting the loss or adding the profit they are
    entitled to.
  </li>
</ul>

<b>Keeper</b>
<ul>
  <li>Creates markets for new underlying assets.</li>
  <li>
    Sets up an Automated Market Maker (AMM) strategy and deposits collateral
    into the smart contract for initial liquidity.
  </li>
  <li>Earns rewards from the activities within the created market.</li>
</ul>
