But stablecoins like USDt, DAI and USDC can be traded in forex-like style. We built true fair and decentralized forex - DeForex. User can invest funds to our Automatic Leveraging Pool (ALP) in 50/50 proportion and get double-token instead. For instance, liquidity provider (LP) invests 5 000 DAI and 5 000 USDC and gets 10 000 DAIUSDC. When trader uses leverage to open position, he pays fee to the ALP. So our DAIUSDC will become an asset with embedded income. And it will be more "stable" than one separate stablecoin: if DAI or USDC will fail, the client at least will stay with 50% of his wealth.',

Also, we will use DEXes to conduct trades and also we were working on DeBridge\'s DeSwap integration for crosschain swaps, but we didn\'t finish it. We want to set up a new standard - Automatic Leveraging System, which will calculate maximal acceptable leverage level to keep the system stable. It will be like Automatic Market Maker and liquidity pool for DEXes. We integrated The Graph to access blockchain data easily. We decided to spare the eyes of the jury and used a ready-made design template from the marketplace for our front-end. Therefore, the main achievement of our team is that we talked with many sponsors, improved our skills and gained new knowledge on the integration of web3 services and, as a result, made an excellent project.
